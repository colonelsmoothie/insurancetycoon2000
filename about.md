Welcome to the Insurance Tycoon 2000 development blog. Insurance Tycoon is an open source, browser-based insurance management simulator. You are the CEO of an insurance company, and the goal is to gain as much market share as possible, while maintaining profitability and solvency.


This project is a work-in-progress, and I'm learning as I go when it comes to most of the project features, so this is the right place to go if you want a detailed account of how I am developing this simulator.
